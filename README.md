## My process

### Built with
- html and css


### What I learned

I didn't learn much, but I discovered a little more about the usefulness of margin and padding, like:

```css
.Learning{
  background:hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  width: 90px;
  margin: 14px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue training some things that I know, like margin and centralization tags like display:flex
